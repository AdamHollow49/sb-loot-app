# Shared Braincell Loot App
The purpose of this repository is to provide a central location for the source code of any application(s) that provide data and dictate loot assignment.

# Requirements
In order to have proper direction when developing the tooling for this purpose, a set of requirements must be established.

- Primary
   - Tier Gear Count Status
   - Weekly Individual Player Loot Assignment Counter
   - Weekly "SBEM" or "Shared Braincell Effort Metric" binary indicator (YES or NO if completed).
- Stretch
   - WoW App?
   - Indicate Performance AVG?

# Form Factor

### Python App
The benefits of using Python are clear - it is a data science tool and can be used to quickly run requests and process the data.

### Web App
Web app improves usability, allows others to also use the app to verify their own status/counter.

### WoW App
The same as Web App in terms of usability, however, requires further development knowledge - added benefit of being seamless within the game.
